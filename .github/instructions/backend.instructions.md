# üöÄ Laravel / PHP / MySQL Backend Best Practices

This guide outlines **best practices** for building a **Laravel backend** using PHP and MySQL. The goal is **clarity, scalability, security, and maintainability**, adhering to Laravel conventions and clean architecture principles.

---

## üìÅ Project Structure

Follow a **standard, organized Laravel structure**:

```

/app
/Http
/Controllers   # Controllers for each resource (QuizController, AdminController, AuthController, ResultController)
/Middleware    # Custom middleware (e.g. Admin authentication)
/Models          # Eloquent models (Quiz, Question, User, Result)
/Policies        # Authorization policies (if used)
/Providers       # Application service providers
/Services        # Service classes for business logic (if logic grows complex)

/routes
web.php          # Web routes (grouped by middleware and feature)
api.php          # API routes (if exposing APIs in future)

/database
/migrations      # Database schema migrations
/seeders         # Seeders for test and demo data
/factories       # Model factories for testing

/resources
/views           # Blade templates integrated with backend data

/public
/assets          # Compiled CSS, JS, images

/tests
/Feature         # Feature tests
/Unit            # Unit tests

.env               # Environment configuration
composer.json      # PHP dependencies

```

üîñ **Rules:**

- **Use RESTful resource controllers** with clear route naming.
- **No business logic in controllers** ‚Äì delegate to Services or Models.
- **Group routes by middleware** (`auth`, `admin`) for clarity and security.
- **Keep controllers thin**, models clean, and views logic-free (MVC discipline).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Database Design Best Practices

‚úÖ **Key Guidelines:**

- Design **normalized relational schemas** with clear foreign keys:
  - `quizzes` table (belongs to admin user)
  - `questions` table (belongs to quiz)
  - `users` table (standard Laravel auth)
  - `results` table (stores user quiz attempts and scores)
- Use **Laravel migrations for all schema changes**, never manual DB edits.
- Define **Eloquent relationships** clearly (e.g. Quiz hasMany Questions).

---

## üîê Authentication & Authorization Best Practices

‚úÖ **Key Guidelines:**

- Use **Laravel Breeze or Jetstream** for authentication scaffolding.
- Implement **role-based access control**:
  - Use an `is_admin` boolean field or a dedicated `roles` table for scalability.
- Protect admin routes with **custom middleware** (`admin`) to restrict access.

---

## ‚ö° Controller & Service Layer Best Practices

‚úÖ **Key Guidelines:**

- Use **Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository** structure if business logic grows:
  - **Controllers** handle HTTP requests and responses.
  - **Services** handle business logic (e.g. quiz score calculation).
  - **Repositories** handle DB queries if abstracting Eloquent.

- **Validation**:
  - Use **Form Request validation classes** for clean controllers.
  - Validate all incoming data before processing.

---

## üîÑ AJAX & API Best Practices

‚úÖ **Key Guidelines:**

- Return **JSON responses for AJAX requests**, with clear success/error status codes.
- Use **CSRF tokens** for all AJAX POST requests to prevent cross-site request forgery.
- In routes, group AJAX endpoints under clear prefixes (e.g. `/quiz/{id}/submit`).

---

## üß™ Testing Best Practices

‚úÖ **Key Guidelines:**

- Write **Feature tests** for:
  - User registration and login.
  - Quiz creation, editing, and deletion.
  - Quiz attempt and result calculation flows.

- Write **Unit tests** for:
  - Score calculation logic.
  - Any complex service or utility classes.

- Use **Laravel factories and seeders** to generate test data efficiently.

---

## üöÄ Deployment Best Practices

‚úÖ **Key Guidelines:**

- Use **GitHub for version control**, commit frequently with meaningful messages.
- Ensure `.env` is configured correctly for the production environment (DB, mail, storage).
- Run **`php artisan migrate --force`** during deployment to apply DB migrations safely.
- Always run **`composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev`** in production.
- Use **Laravel scheduler and queue worker** if needed for future background tasks.

---

## üîí Security Best Practices

‚úÖ **Key Guidelines:**

- Use **Laravel built-in protection** for SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
- Hash all passwords using Laravel‚Äôs default bcrypt.
- Validate all user inputs server-side even if frontend validations exist.
- Never expose sensitive environment variables or database credentials in any Blade view or JS.

By following these **Laravel / PHP / MySQL backend best practices**, the **Quiz Builder and Hosting Platform** will remain scalable, secure, and maintainable for long-term use and future enhancements.
